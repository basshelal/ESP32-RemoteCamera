# Notes

## Setup
When you first boot the camera, it should start as a Wifi access point that you connect to
(with a default password or open, undecided), from which, you then go to a web page that the
camera is serving (ie 192.168.0.1) that will contain wifi setup to an actual access point. 
This is akin to how some wifi printers do their SSID and password setup.
In order to re-enter this Access Point mode, you need to press and hold a "reset" button on 
the camera. This is useful when you have changed Wifi access point and can no longer access 
the camera, this reset button should be software based and only change the state containing 
wifi access point.

## Save Clips
The camera should have a button to signal that the user would like to save the last clip (however 
long we decide to set it, 15 or 30 seconds is good) similar to how some car dash-cams do this. 
These clips get saved into the SD card. 

## Over-The-Air Update Feature
It would be very cool to allow for Over-The-Air (OTA) software updates like how some routers do
this. This could be very complicated though but is a good flex of skills
